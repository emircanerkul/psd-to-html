# PSD to Html

I wanted to learn how to psd to html and improve my frontend skills.

Used: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Editor), [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) (Psd Reader), [Freebiesbug](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/website-template/) (Psd Templates) [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/tr/) (Free Images) [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/tr_tr/chrome/) (Browser), [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) (OS)

Firstly i want to use own grid system instead of ready-to-use grid systems. I developed fully independent non-responsive html template.

### Minimo Blog [preview](https://github.com/emircanerkul/psd-to-html/tree/master/minimo)

I aimed to use different technologies at every stage of this project for my education and portfolio. At this stage of the project, I converted the minimo psd design to responsive html template using [sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [neat](https://neat.bourbon.io/) and [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/).
